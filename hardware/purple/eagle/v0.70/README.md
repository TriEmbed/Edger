## Changes since 0.60
1. Add switches for Enable, GPIO8, GPIO9 for reset and boot control
2. 4.7uF from Enable to ground to stretch it's time spent low
3. I2C pullups changed to 10k 'cause the signal paths are very short
4. Improve labeling
5. Spell aardvark correctly
6. Fix mirror image label ("GND")
