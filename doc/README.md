# que_league repository - general info about project Edger

Here is general information about project Edger (latin for oak), the TriEmbed open source community project launched in 2021 to create development boards and software combining Espressif MPUs and FPGAs. 

## This repo vs others in TriEmbed:
Other repos might belong to TriEmbed individuals for their personal projects, a different community project, etc. Those with names prefixed by que_ cover specific subsystems or topics pertaining to Edger.

## Conventions
1. All directory and filenames names other than project/repo names should be lower case to avoid OS filesystem headaches to the extent possible (files coming from vendors such as via .zip files may be exceptions). When adding new files and directories make them all lower case if possible. 
2. Ditto for avoiding embedded spaces and hyphens or weird characters in directory or filenames that one of the big three OS flavors cannot understand, requires quoting, etc. Stick with letters, digits, underscore, and periods if possible.
3. There are coding style "pretty printer" scripts in que_tools.
