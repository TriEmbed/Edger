## api/cli/examples/edgerBMP 
This directory contains an application that periodically prints temperature measurements to a terminal session. It does not need aardvark, just the USB connection of a "white" dev board to the computer to be displaying temperatures from an I2C breakout board with added sensor and a shared WIFI connection with the dev board.
