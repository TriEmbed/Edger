# Edger
Edger is a standalone system for developing for and using the combination of a WIFI-capable ESP32 and one or more Renesas/Dialog mixed signal FPGA chips or peripheral development boards and breakout boards having I2C interfaces. The Renesas/ForgeFPGA synthesis tool used to create FPGA images has a drag and drop GUI that involves zero Verilog or VHDL. It has a built in simulator and generates files that Edger can program in place in the user's system for simple FPGA applications. These FPGAs are around one to two dollars in single quantity, even ones mounted on a DIP board that can plug into a wireless breadboard. Edger is aimed at making FPGAs available to "the rest of us" while also creating a development ecosystem to augment the Espressif IDF and Arduino IDE.
