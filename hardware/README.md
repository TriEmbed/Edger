## Purple - Full custom PCB: ESP32C3 + sockets for FORGEFpga 20 pin DIP board or SMD adapter designed for 830 point solderless breadboard. Reflow soldered except for male header pins. Uses a Renesas 46585 or similar FORGEFpga for voltage regulation (and perhaps sequencing)
## White - Combination 830 point solderless breadbord, ESP32 dev board and SLG47004V-DIP FPGA: Just instructions for a do it yourself assembly functionally equivalent to Purple board. No soldering required.
## Green - Future: "Motherboard" for Purple functionality, peripherals, peripheral connectors and large uncommited area. All reflow soldered except optional female headers? 

In the beginning was Sylogics. Then Dialog bought Sylogics. Dialog created the marketing name "GreenPak" for their simple mixed signal FPGAs. Renesas bought Dialog and changed the "GreenPak" name to "FORGEFpga". The documents on the Internet are a mish-mash of old and new names.
